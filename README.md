## Course description

This course will provide an introduction to geospatial data with R. We will review different data formats (e.g. shapefiles, rasters, etc.), as well as methods to extract and visualize the data.


## Resources for learning R

There are quite a few (free!) resources available online to help you learn R. 
- [An Introduction to R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf)
- [R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html)
- [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)

In addition to online resources, TA sections in this course will be devoted to help with R. Bring all your questions there!


## Resources for geospatial data in R

- [An Introduction to Spatial Data Analysis and Visualisation in R](https://www.spatialanalysisonline.com/An%20Introduction%20to%20Spatial%20Data%20Analysis%20in%20R.pdf): This document is a bit dated but provides a nice review of geospatial data. For up-to-date R functions, please use the following two resources.
- [The sf package](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/): This website provides an overview of the sf package, which we will use for visualizing maps.
- [The terra package](https://rspatial.org/pkg/): This website provides an excellent overview of geospatial functions available in the terra package.


## Other resources
There are also two slide decks that are extremely helpful:
- Grant McDermott's slides: [https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures](https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures) (these slides focus on data science and R)


## Weekly slides

You can find the slides (and any data we will be using) for each week in this folder. Most weeks will have just a single slide deck. Note that you can also find the raw .qmd file that I used to create the slides. You might find these helpful, though you are by no means required to look at them.
