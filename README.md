## Course description




## Resources for learning R

There are quite a few (free!) resources available online to help you learn R. 
- [An Introduction to R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf)
- [R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html)
- [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)

In addition to online resources, TA sections in this course will be devoted to help with R. Bring all your questions there!

## Other resources
There are also two slide decks that are extremely helpful:
- Grant McDermott's slides: [https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures](https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures) (these slides focus on data science and R)


## Weekly slides

You can find the slides (and any data we will be using) for each week under their respective folders (weeks/). Most weeks will have just a single slide deck. Note that in each week's folder, you can also find the raw .Rmd file that I used to create the slides. You might find these helpful, though you are by no means required to look at them.



## Assignments

I will also post your assignments here, under the [assignments folder](assignments/).
