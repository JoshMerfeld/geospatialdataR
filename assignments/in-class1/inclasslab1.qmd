You can find all of the data in the assignments/in-class1/data folder. The datasets are:

  - seoulgrid.shp: a grid of 100m x 100m cells covering Seoul
  - seoulgu.shp: the administrative districts (gu/êµ¬) of Seoul
  - seoulrail.shp: the rail stations in Seoul
  - seoulwater.shp: the water bodies in Seoul
  - seoulpoints.csv: points of interest in Seoul
  
By the end of class, you need to turn in a raw markdown file AND the pdf output. Please make sure ALL STUDENTS' names are on the assignment. Here are your tasks for today:

  - Let's start easy. The grid shapefile has a variable in it: estimated population in the grid cell (from [WorldPop](https://www.worldpop.org/)). Load the grid shapefile and plot the population distribution in Seoul. Please make the map look nice.
    - You'll notice there are a lot of grid cells with missing values. Please write what you think might be going on there.
  - Next, filter out any grid cells that are majority water. Plot the population distribution in Seoul again.
    - Please write what you think the missing values are again.
  - I forgot to put the Gu identifier into the grid cells. Please add that using the seoulgu.shp file.
